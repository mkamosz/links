                        In a previous post about testing I mentioned that route resolves can make authoring unit tests for a controller easier. Resolves can also help the user experience.

                        A resolve is a property you can attach to a route in both ngRoute and the more robust UI router. A resolve contains one or more promises that must resolve successfully before the route will change. This means you can wait for data to become available before showing a view, and simplify the initialization of the model inside a controller because the initial data is given to the controller instead of the controller needing to go out and fetch the data.

                        As an example, let’s use the following simple service which uses $q to simulate the async work required to fetch some data.
                    </p>
